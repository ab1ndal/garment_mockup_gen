MEN_SHIRT_PROMPT="""
Generate an ultra-realistic, hyper-detailed, high-end editorial mockup of a men’s full-sleeve shirt, based on the [UPLOADED IMAGE HERE]. The shirt must precisely incorporate every garment detail explicitly visible and present in the uploaded image, including fabric texture, weave, collar style, placket design, cuff structure, stitching lines, pocket shape (if any), and button placement.  
The final output MUST be indistinguishable from a professional 8K photograph, as if captured by a high-end full-frame DSLR camera with a fast prime lens (e.g., 85mm f/1.4), suitable for a luxury menswear brand’s e-commerce catalog and high-resolution social media (Instagram, WhatsApp).  

Absolute Priority: Every garment detail visible in the [UPLOADED IMAGE HERE] must be an exact, perfect, pixel-for-pixel replication of the reference. This includes the precise fabric weave, collar roll, cuff folds, button sheen, and any visible embellishments or patterns. DO NOT HALLUCINATE ANY NEW GARMENTS, LAYERS, PATTERNS, OR ELEMENTS NOT PRESENT IN THE REFERENCE. Avoid generic substitutes or deviations. No changes to print, color, or weave are allowed.  
Preserve any logos or design elements that are part of the shirt itself, but remove all external product tags, price tags, or branding labels not intrinsic to the garment.  

Model & Pose: A refined young **Indian origin male model**, with head fully visible, authentic and natural body language, and a confident, approachable presence. Expression must be genuine, happy, and realistic. **Framing must be belt-up (waist to head)**. The shirt must be neatly tucked in, with a visible smart belt that complements the shirt’s design for a polished catalog look. The model may be engaged in subtle lifestyle activities (e.g., adjusting a cuff, buttoning the shirt, holding a coffee cup, using a phone, walking casually, light conversation), but the **shirt must remain the clear focal point** of the mockup.  

Garment & Styling: The shirt should be impeccably tailored, wrinkle-free, and exude a luxury finish, styled as if freshly pressed. Collars must be crisp and standing correctly, cuffs must be visible and neatly aligned, and buttons should be properly closed as per the uploaded reference. The belt must be simple, elegant, and aligned symmetrically to enhance the neat tucked-in appearance. **The belt color must be neutral (black, brown, or a shade that complements the shirt), never flashy or distracting.**  

Accessories: Minimal to none. If visible in the reference, subtle additions like a sleek watch or simple cufflinks may be included, but no ties, jackets, or unrelated items.  

Technical & Aesthetic Requirements: 8K resolution, razor-sharp, hyper-detailed clarity throughout, capturing every stitch, seam, thread, and micro-texture.  

Lighting: Bright, soft, professional studio lighting designed for catalog photography. Even illumination across the shirt to show true fabric color and weave. No harsh shadows or dramatic rim lighting.  

Background: Impeccably clean, seamless white or neutral-toned studio backdrop, optimized for e-commerce catalog display. Lifestyle context may be allowed (minimal furniture, office, café, or neutral environment) only if subtle and non-distracting, ensuring the shirt remains the focal point.  

Depth of Field: Shallow depth of field to gently blur the background while keeping the model and shirt perfectly in focus, consistent with prime lens product photography.

SAREE_PROMPT = """
Generate an ultra-realistic, hyper-detailed, high-end editorial mockup of a saree, based on the [UPLOADED SAREE IMAGE HERE]. The final output MUST be indistinguishable from a professional 8K photograph, as if captured by a high-end full-frame DSLR camera with a fast prime lens (e.g., 85mm f/1.4), suitable for a luxury Indian ethnicwear brand’s magazine and high-resolution social media (Instagram, WhatsApp).
Absolute Priority: The saree must be an exact, perfect, pixel-for-pixel replication of the one in the [UPLOADED SAREE IMAGE HERE]. This includes precise fabric texture, every single motif, intricate border details, and any specific embellishments like scattered stones, sequins, or embroidery on the body of the saree. DO NOT HALLUCINATE ANY NEW PATTERNS OR DEVIATE FROM THE REFERENCE SAREE'S DESIGN. Avoid generic saree patterns. No deviation in print or weave. Absolutely no patterns not present in the uploaded image. 

Model Realism Requirement: The person must look alive, natural, and fully human. Ensure natural skin texture, facial micro-expressions, organic body posture, and realistic hair flow. Avoid all mannequin-like features such as plastic or glossy skin, blank doll-like eyes, stiff poses, artificial joints, or lifeless expressions. The model should exude warmth and presence, as if photographed during a real luxury fashion editorial shoot.

Regarding the Pallu (where design info may be missing from reference):
The pallu should be draped elegantly over the back, allowing the main body and visible border details of the saree to be the focal point.
If the [UPLOADED SAREE IMAGE HERE] does not clearly show the pallu's specific design or detailing:
a) Prioritize a natural drape that subtly displays the pallu, avoiding focus on unreferenced patterns. The composition should highlight the main body and visible border details.
b) If the pallu is necessarily prominent, generate a simple, complementary design based on the saree's base color or dominant border color. This could be a solid block of color, or a very subtle, textural self-weave. Absolutely no complex, new, or hallucinated motifs should appear on unreferenced pallu sections.
Model & Pose: A graceful young Indian female model with a subtle, gentle, confident smile. Full-length, head-to-toe shot, front view, in a natural, poised, and elegant stance that beautifully highlights the saree’s elegance and flow and the fabric's drape.
Garment & Styling: The saree should be draped in the traditional Nivi style, with the pallu neatly draped over the back. Ensure pleats and drape are crisp, wrinkle-free, and exude a luxurious finish with professional steam and styling.
Blouse Styles: Since the blouse may not be fully visible in reference images, generate a blouse design that perfectly complements the saree while maintaining a high-fashion editorial look (AI to randomize): Classic half-sleeve, sleeveless, boat-neck, sweetheart neckline, halter-neck, off-shoulder, high-neck, deep back, corset-style, or an elaborately embellished designer blouse.
Accessories: Minimal yet exceptionally classy—select from statement earrings, elegant bangles/bracelets, a subtle bindi, or tasteful heels. The accessories should enhance, not distract from, the saree. Ensure they have a realistic sheen and reflection.
Technical & Aesthetic Requirements:8K resolution, with razor-sharp, hyper-detailed quality throughout, capturing every individual thread, weave, and embellishment with utmost clarity, depth, and micro-texture.Lighting: Exquisite, soft, professional editorial studio lighting.

VIDEO_PROMPT = """
An 8-second, single-take cinematic shot of a beautiful Indian woman in a
green and gold traditional dress with a sheer yellow dupatta. The setting is a
modern conservatory oasis with polished dark concrete floors and lush,
out-of-focus greenery behind large glass panels at twilight. The lighting is
soft, warm, and cinematic.

The video begins with her in a three-quarter profile. She turns to the camera
and begins to walk slowly forward. Her sheer yellow dupatta drapes over one
shoulder and flows distinctly beside her, catching the light with subtle
translucency. In one fluid, sweeping gesture, she lifts the side of her skirt
and gently tosses it forward, creating a magnificent rolling wave of fabric
that billows beside her, while the dupatta continues to trail gracefully,
separate from the skirt. This is a graceful, linear "casting" motion, not a
spin. The camera smoothly tracks backward, keeping her in frame.

As the wave of fabric cascades down, she comes to an elegant stop, facing the
camera with a confident expression. The skirt settles around her in luxurious
folds, and the dupatta falls softly into place as a delicate finishing touch,
ending on a powerful and serene final pose.
